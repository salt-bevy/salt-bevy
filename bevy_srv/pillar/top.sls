# file /bevy_srv/pillar/top.sls
#
#   This is an actual pillar top file (not a template) used by the Bevy Master server
#     (on Bevy Master servers where files can be shared with your development workstation)
#     (it will be pulled from the git repo and may be overwritten from it, or pushed to it.)
#
#   In practice, this file will only be used by early "salt-call --local" runs.
#   /srv/pillar/top.sls will be the real thing in normal operation.
#
# The Bevy Master is expected to be run with a /etc/salt/master.d/??? configuration like:
# pillar_root:
#   - /srv/pillar
#   - /bevy_srv/pillar
#
# make local modifications in /srv/pillar/???
